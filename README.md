# {TITLE}

This is the example repo for my blog post on [{TITLE}]({URL})

To run this example:

1. Make sure you have Java, JDK, and Maven installed
2. Clone the repo
3. Run `mvn clean compile assembly:single` - this should give you a JAR file in the `target` folder
4. Run `java -jar target/{PROJECTDIR}-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` to run the JAR file
